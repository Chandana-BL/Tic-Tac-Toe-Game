# 🎲 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## The Classic Game with a Modern Twist 🕹️

Welcome to my **Tic-Tac-Toe** game! It’s a digital version of the classic game you know and love, where X's and O's battle for grid supremacy.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **X** and **O** take turns.
- **X** always goes first (the computer has the edge!).
- Get three in a row, column, or diagonal to win!

The game checks for a win, a tie, or if the game continues after each move.

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **HTML** for building the game layout.
- **CSS** for styling the grid and making it look neat.
- **JavaScript** for the game logic, like detecting the winner and making the computer play.

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. **Download the Code**
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser to start playing.
3. **Enjoy the game** and see if you can beat the computer!

## 🤖 Features

- **Computer plays as X**: It always starts the game with an X in the middle.
- **Random moves**: The computer picks its next move randomly.
- **Game status**: See if you've won, lost, or tied after each move.

## 🏆 Challenges

- Can you beat the computer, or will it outsmart you? Give it a try!
